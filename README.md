# Command-Parser
My final 3-person group project that I did in my Software Engineering class at Eastern Washington University. I did approximately 85% of this project myself and I was one of two people in the 60-person class who received a full 110/100 score for the project.


--Brief Overview--
This project was a piece of a bigger project that Dr. Tappan (my Software Engineering Professor) had previously done that he tasked us with completing. His entire project was an airplane simulator that would accurately show how the movement of different parts on an airplane would affect an airplane's position. Our job was to create the command parser that the "user" would utilize to move the different parts on the plane. There were around 40 different commands categorized into 5 different categories that we had to account for. We were tasked with planning from scratch how we wanted to solve the problem, solving the problem, and then performing extensive testing to ensure that our code did everything it was supposed to do and nothing it was not supposed to do for the project as a whole. Because this project was a part of a bigger project that our professor had completed in the past, we had to reference his previously established architecture/code base to accurately complete this project and make our code fit "like a puzzle piece" with the already existing code.
